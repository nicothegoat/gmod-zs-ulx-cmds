# ZS ULX Commands

A collection of ULX commands for the Zombie Survival gamemode.  
Heavily inspired by Swingflip's addon of the same name.

## Commands:

- `redeem <TARGETS> [<RESPAWN IN PLACE>]`  
	Redeem target(s).
	Targets will be respawned at their current position if `RESPAWN IN PLACE` is true.

- `forceboss <TARGETS> [<SILENT>] [<RESPAWN IN PLACE>]`  
	Respawn target(s) as their selected boss.  
	This will not trigger the 'boss spawned' message + sound if `SILENT` is true.

- `forceclass <TARGETS> <CLASS> [<RESPAWN IN PLACE>]`  
	Respawn target(s) as the specified class.

- `waveactive <BOOL>`  
	Start or end the wave.

- `wavetime <MINUTES>`  
	Set time until wave start/end.

- `givepoints <POINTS> [<GIVE SCORE>]`  
	Give points to target(s).  
	This will also give score/frags if `GIVE SCORE` is true.

- `giveweapon <WEAPON> [<GIVE AMMO>]`
